# Auto-Indoor-Hydroponic-Fodder-Grow-Chamber-
An Auto Indoor Hydroponic Fodder Grow Chamber is a fully automated, soil-less system that grows fresh green fodder indoors using controlled temperature, light, humidity, and water, producing nutritious feed in 6–8 days with minimal space and water.

#Project Overview

The Auto Indoor Hydroponic Fodder Grow Chamber is an automated indoor system designed to grow fresh, nutritious green fodder without soil. The project focuses on controlled environment agriculture using hydroponics to achieve fast growth, water efficiency, and consistent fodder quality.

#Role & Contribution

Team Lead of a 8-member group
Project conceived, designed, and completed by me with my team

Responsible for:
1.System planning and architecture
2.Automation logic and workflow
3.Development of core C++ code for the model, including sensor handling, automation control, and timing logic
4.Testing, monitoring, and result analysis
5.Coordinated tasks, guided team members, and ensured timely project completion

#Technologies & Components Used

1.Hydroponic growing trays
2.Sensors (Temperature, Humidity, Water level)
3.Microcontroller-based automation
4.LED grow lights
5.Automated watering/misting system
6.Controlled indoor chamber structure

#Results & Outcomes

1.Successfully grew green fodder within 6–8 days
2.Achieved uniform growth and good root development
3.Reduced water usage by up to 90% compared to traditional farming
4.Required minimal human intervention due to automation
5.Demonstrated year-round fodder production independent of climate

#Challenges Faced

1.Maintaining optimal humidity and temperature balance
2.Preventing fungal growth in a closed environment
3.Calibrating sensors for accurate readings
4.Managing uniform light distribution across trays
5.Initial troubleshooting of automation timing and water flow

#Conclusion

This project demonstrates practical knowledge of automation, hydroponics, teamwork, and problem-solving. It highlights my ability to lead a team, design a real-world solution, and deliver measurable results, making it a strong foundation for roles in IoT, automation, and smart agriculture.
